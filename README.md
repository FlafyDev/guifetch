# Guifetch
A GUI fetch tool written in Flutter.

## Development
Works, but you'll probably want to edit the `lib/info.dart` file for information to be correct like `neofetch`. (If you do so, please PR)

## Config
Located at `~/.config/guifetch/guifetch.toml`.
- `background_color` = Background color : `0xAARRGGBB`
- `os_id` = Which os id's image to display : `string`
